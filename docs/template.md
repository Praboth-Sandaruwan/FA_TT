# Project Documentation Template

Use this template as a starting point for all project-level documentation. Replace the italicised guidance with project-specific details and add any additional sections that are relevant to the domain.

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose:** _Summarise the problem the project solves and the key outcomes._
- **Audience:** _Describe who should read this document and any prerequisites they should have._
- **Status & Owners:** _List the current status (draft, in progress, production) and primary maintainers._

## 2. Setup & Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- _List required tooling (e.g. Python version, Docker, external CLIs)._ 
- _Reference any services or credentials needed to run the project locally._

### 2.2 Local Environment Setup

1. _Provide step-by-step instructions for cloning the repository or project directory._
2. _Document environment variable preparation (e.g. copying `.env.example`)._
3. _Outline dependency installation (Poetry, npm, pip, etc.)._
4. _Explain how to start local services, containers, or emulators._

### 2.3 Verification

- _Describe how to confirm the application is running correctly (health checks, sample requests, UI smoke test)._ 
- _Include pointers to automated tests that validate the setup._

## 3. Architecture Overview

- _Provide a short narrative describing the overall system design._
- _Embed or link architecture diagrams stored under [`docs/diagrams/`](./diagrams/README.md)._ 
- _List core components/services, their responsibilities, and key dependencies._
- _Document data stores, asynchronous workflows, and external integrations._

### 3.1 Component Breakdown

| Component | Responsibility | Technology | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Service / Module_ | _What it does_ | _Language / Framework_ | _Scaling, limitations, SLAs_ |

### 3.2 Data Flow & Contracts

- _Describe request/response lifecycles, queues, and scheduled jobs._
- _Link to API specifications, event schemas, or ER diagrams as applicable._

## 4. Feature Walkthrough

### 4.1 Core Scenarios

- _Narrate the primary user journeys or system workflows._
- _Highlight any feature flags, configuration toggles, or secrets required._

### 4.2 Interfaces & APIs

- _List public endpoints, CLI commands, or UIs exposed by the project._
- _Reference swagger/openAPI specs, CLI help output, or UX mocks._

### 4.3 Background Processes

- _Document recurring jobs, batch processes, or message consumers._
- _Include scheduling details, throughput expectations, and monitoring hooks._

## 5. Operations & Maintenance

- _Outline deployment pipelines (CI/CD jobs, manual steps, approvals)._ 
- _Describe monitoring and alerting (dashboards, alert thresholds, on-call rotation)._ 
- _Capture backup/restore procedures and disaster recovery considerations._

## 6. Troubleshooting Guide

- _List common issues, symptoms, and their resolutions._
- _Provide log file locations, debug commands, and access requirements._
- _Reference runbooks or escalation paths for critical incidents._

## 7. Project Documentation Checklist

Use the checklist below before marking the documentation as complete:

- [ ] README and doc headers reference this template for future maintainers.
- [ ] Setup instructions have been validated on a clean environment.
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets are documented with defaults or procurement steps.
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (and source files) are stored under [`docs/diagrams/`](./diagrams/README.md).
- [ ] Key workflows and APIs include links to specs or example payloads.
- [ ] Operational duties (deployments, monitoring, alerts) are described.
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers the top failure modes with actionable steps.
- [ ] Supporting assets (dashboards, runbooks, tickets) are linked for deeper context.

_Adapt this template to the project size: remove sections that are not applicable and add specific appendices (e.g. data dictionary, glossary, SLA) when helpful._
