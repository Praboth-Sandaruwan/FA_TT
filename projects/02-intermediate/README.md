# Intermediate Project Documentation

Use the shared documentation template to ensure consistency across projects. The recommended workflow is:

1. Copy [`docs/template.md`](../../docs/template.md) into the project docs location and customise each section.
2. Commit diagrams and other supporting media within [`docs/diagrams`](../../docs/diagrams/README.md), grouping assets under a `02-intermediate/` subdirectory.
3. Review the repository-wide [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting updates.

Update this README with the fully authored documentation once the template has been applied.
