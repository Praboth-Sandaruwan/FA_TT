# Beginner Project Documentation

Project documentation should follow the shared repository template to keep structure and expectations aligned. When updating or extending docs for this project:

- Start from [`docs/template.md`](../../docs/template.md) and tailor it to the project's specifics.
- Store diagrams or media assets under [`docs/diagrams`](../../docs/diagrams/README.md), using a subdirectory such as `docs/diagrams/01-beginner/`.
- Cross-reference the [contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening pull requests.

Replace this stub with project-specific content once documentation has been authored using the template.
